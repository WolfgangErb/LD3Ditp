Description
-----------

The package LD3Ditp contains a Matlab and a Python implementation for 3D polynomial interpolation on 
the node points LD of degenerate 3D-Lissajous curves. 

The main test file for the interpolation are  
main_example.m and main_example.py

For plotting 3D degenerate Lissajous curves, the LD points as well as the index sets used in the 
polynomial interpolation use plot_Lissajous3D.m or plot_LD3D.py, respectively.

The file plotregion.m in the Matlab package was written by Per Bergstr√∂m 2006-01-16. In this package it is used as 
an auxiliary program in plot_Lissajous3D.m to plot the polygonal boundary of the index sets.
